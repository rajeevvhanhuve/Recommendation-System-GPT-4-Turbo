Amazing ambience coupled with some great food. BonSouth is one restaurant you shouldnt miss when you are in Koramanagala and you love South Indian Food. The buffet was great and has many dishes to satisfy your cravings for food. Especially in the Non Veg section starting with typical kalmi to plankatin leaf fish to boneless kebab to fried prawns and a bit of south Indian break fast items. Main course was even better with Appam and accompaniments ranging from South Indian Fish Curry, Golconda chicken... Some great mutton.. Don't seem to remember the names and top of the list is the Vegetable Stew. Best I had in Bangalore so far... We spent good 90-120 minutes and didn't try much on the desserts section. Can get crowded on weekends for both lunch and dinner hence book your reservation in advance and take an outdoor seat if it is not raining. Not a single dish disappointed us.

I had been for a family lunch. Truly South Indian cuisine and very unique. Starters will be served to table. Decor is creative and soothing.

Chicken curry was just water with a piece of worst chicken..\\\"), ('Rated 4.0', \\\"RATED\\\\n  Went here at a saturday afternoon at around 2.30 pm. Had a paneer paratha and lassi. Paratha was just like that of my mom makes at home. Paratha was quite big and had a generous amount of filling. Tasted great. Lassi was king size and tasted superb, but compared to lassi's we get in punjab, it was no match. All this filled up my tummy with no room left. Both items costed me 90 rupees. Great bang for the buck.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, superb experience. Will visit again to try some nonveg and rajma.\\\")]\",\n          \"[('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\\\\n  Access in decent area very friendly staff must visit place in jpnagar from veg to noveg best deserve prices I recommend all must visit one big hall is there sit and eat')]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cuisines\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"North Indian, Asian, Seafood, Chinese\",\n          \"North Indian, Chinese\",\n          \"North Indian\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

By harnessing GPT-4's advanced natural language processing capabilities, we can better interpret user preferences, analyze contextual information, and generate more personalized suggestions. The goal is to create a dynamic recommendation engine that not only relies on historical data but also understands user intent and context, ultimately enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. This collaboration aims to transform the way users discover relevant content and products, leading to improved outcomes and experiences."
